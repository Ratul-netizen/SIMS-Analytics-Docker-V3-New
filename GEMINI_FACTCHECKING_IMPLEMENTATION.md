## Complete Fact-Checking Process

### Step 1: Article Ingestion
When a new article is ingested into the system:
1. **Source Detection**: Article is fetched from Exa API (news aggregation service)
2. **Content Extraction**: Full text and metadata are extracted
3. **Preprocessing**: Content is cleaned and formatted for AI analysis
4. **Analysis Trigger**: Gemini AI analysis is automatically initiated

### Step 2: Gemini AI Analysis
The system sends the article to Gemini AI with a comprehensive analysis prompt:

**The Complete Gemini Prompt:**
```
Analyze this Bangladesh-India related news article for SIMS Analytics Dashboard:

**Title:** [Article Title]
**Content:** [First 4000 characters of article content]

Please provide a comprehensive analysis in the following format:

**SUMMARY:**
Provide a complete 2-3 sentence summary of the main story and its significance.

**SENTIMENT:** [positive/negative/neutral/cautious]

**CATEGORY:** [politics/sports/technology/crime/health/education/business/entertainment/environment/others]

**GEOPOLITICAL IMPLICATIONS:**
Analyze the impact on Bangladesh-India relations and regional dynamics.

**MEDIA BIAS ASSESSMENT:**
Evaluate the reporting perspective, potential bias, and framing of the story.

**FACT-CHECKING SOURCES:**
Use web search to find actual news articles that cover this same story. VERIFY each URL works before including it.

**VERIFICATION PROCESS:**
1. Search for articles about this topic
2. For each potential source, VISIT the URL to confirm it exists and loads properly
3. Only include URLs that you have successfully verified are working
4. Format verified sources exactly like this:

**VERIFIED SOURCES:**
1. SOURCE: [Source Name] | COUNTRY: [Bangladesh/India/International] | URL: https://verified-working-url.com/article-path | VERIFIED: âœ“
2. SOURCE: [Source Name] | COUNTRY: [Bangladesh/India/International] | URL: https://verified-working-url.com/article-path | VERIFIED: âœ“

Search priorities:
- **BANGLADESH**: thedailystar.net, prothomalo.com, dhakatribune.com, bdnews24.com, newagebd.net, dailyjanakantha.com, samakal.com, banglatribune.com, somoynews.tv, jamuna.tv
- **INDIA**: timesofindia.indiatimes.com, thehindu.com, economictimes.indiatimes.com, hindustantimes.com, ndtv.com, indianexpress.com, news18.com, business-standard.com
- **INTERNATIONAL**: bbc.com, reuters.com, aljazeera.com, cnn.com, apnews.com, theguardian.com, nytimes.com, france24.com, dw.com

**KEY ENTITIES:**
List important people, places, organizations mentioned.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- VERIFY each URL actually works by visiting it before including in results
- Only include URLs that return valid content (not 404, not blocked, not redirected to homepage)
- URLs must be complete and functional (https://domain.com/article/path)
- Do NOT create fake, generic, or unverified URLs
- If no working sources found after verification, state "NO VERIFIED SOURCES FOUND"
- Each URL must link to a specific news article about this exact topic
- Include "VERIFIED: âœ“" for each working URL you confirm
```

### Step 3: AI Processing and Web Search
Gemini AI performs the following tasks:
1. **Content Analysis**: Analyzes the article's content, sentiment, and category
2. **Web Search**: Uses integrated Google Search to find related articles
3. **URL Verification**: Visits each found URL to verify it's functional
4. **Source Categorization**: Classifies sources as Bangladesh, India, or International
5. **Structured Response**: Returns formatted analysis with verified sources

### Step 4: Response Processing
The system processes Gemini's response through multiple validation layers:

1. **Source Extraction**: Parses verified sources from Gemini's response
2. **URL Validation**: Additional backend validation for unverified URLs
3. **Domain Filtering**: Removes self-referencing sources
4. **Fact-Check Determination**: Applies verification rules

### Step 5: Fact-Check Status Determination
The system uses a two-category verification system:

**Verification Rules:**
- **VERIFIED** (ðŸŸ¢): Must have â‰¥1 Bangladesh source AND â‰¥1 International source
- **UNVERIFIED** (ðŸŸ¡): Only Bangladesh sources, only International sources, or no sources

**Source Categories:**
- **Bangladesh Sources**: thedailystar.net, prothomalo.com, dhakatribune.com, bdnews24.com, etc.
- **India Sources**: timesofindia.indiatimes.com, thehindu.com, economictimes.indiatimes.com, etc.
- **International Sources**: bbc.com, reuters.com, aljazeera.com, cnn.com, etc.

### Step 6: Database Storage
Analysis results are stored in structured format:
- **Summary**: AI-generated article summary
- **Sentiment**: Positive/negative/neutral/cautious
- **Category**: News category classification
- **Fact-Check Status**: Verified/unverified with sources
- **Geopolitical Implications**: Impact analysis
- **Media Bias Assessment**: Bias evaluation
- **Key Entities**: Important people, places, organizations

### Step 7: Frontend Display
Results are displayed in the dashboard with:
